## What is Desert soul?

Desert Soul is a 2D pixel art metroidvania currently in the demo development phase as part of my creative portfolio class at Champlain College. This game will include in depth combat systems, skill trees, a uniqe story, and wild and zanny metroidvania style upgrades to change your playstyle

## The Future

After the demo is completed, I plan to introduce the demo to a wider development team in order to fully flesh out the game and kickstart further development with an eventual public release in mind.
