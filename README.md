## What is Desert soul?

Desert Soul is a 2D pixel art metroidvania currently in the demo development phase as part of my creative portfolio class at Champlain College. This game will include in depth combat systems, skill trees, a uniqe story, and wild and zanny metroidvania style upgrades to change your playstyle

## What the build features:

The Current Desert Soul build features a movment sandbox where you can move around in a small 2D jungle gym. This build features fall acceleration, coyote time, and responsive movment that has been tuned for the demo.

## Upcoming features:

Next, I plan to implement the weapon combo based combat that is at the core of the game. This will allow the player to string together a variety of attacks that will allow them to dispatch their enemies in flashy ways. I will also be working on basic enemies with basic AI to allow the player something to test their skills against.

## To-Do List:

The Demo of Desert soul will include the following features:

- A blocked out first area
- First Boss Base Implementation
- First metroidvania upgrade
- 2 basic enemy types
- Combo System
- Upgrade tree(?)
